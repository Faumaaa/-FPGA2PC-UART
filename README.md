# -FPGA2PC-UART
## FPGA-UART-Comms  This project demonstrates communication between an FPGA and a PC using UART protocol, with all code written in Verilog. It includes Verilog modules for UART transmission and reception,button debouncing check, and example scripts for PC-side communication. Ideal for understanding and implementing UART with FPGAs.
